# Silent Data Fetch Failure in Next.js Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js applications involving dynamic routes and data fetching using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`. When invalid dynamic route segments are provided, the error handling isn't always clear, leading to blank pages or server errors without informative error messages.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when data fetching within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` relies on dynamic route parameters that may be invalid or malformed.  Instead of a clear 404, the application might render with missing data or throw a server-side error that's difficult to trace.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to a route with a malformed slug (e.g., `/post/invalid-slug` with special characters).
5. Observe that the page loads but the data is missing, or a server error occurs without a helpful message.

## Solution
The solution involves robust input validation and comprehensive error handling within the data fetching functions. This ensures that errors are caught, and appropriate responses (such as a 404 page) are returned to the client.
