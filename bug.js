In Next.js, a fairly uncommon error arises when using server-side props (getStaticProps or getServerSideProps) alongside dynamic routes.  If you fetch data based on a dynamic route segment that doesn't exist or is improperly formatted, you might encounter unexpected behavior, such as a blank page or an error 500. This is different from the usual 404 because the page technically renders, but with incorrect or missing data, making debugging more challenging. For example, imagine a blog post page at `/post/[slug]` where you fetch a post by its slug.  If the slug in the URL is invalid (e.g., contains characters not allowed in the database), the data fetching will fail silently or might throw an exception on the server, without clear indication of the exact issue.
